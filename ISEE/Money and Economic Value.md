### Time Value Of Money

-   The money available at the **present time  ** is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its **potential earning capacity**.
-   Ex. As long as positive interest rate holds a money that is received today earns upto i% of interest in bank.

### Interest

-   It is the amount of money that the borrower pays in addition to the principal amount .
-   Two types 
    1.  **Simple Interest**
        -   It is calculated on the principal amount.
    2.  **Compound Interest**
        -   It is calculated on the principal amount and the accumulated interest of previous periods.
        -   Thus called as **interest on interest**.
        -   When calculating compound interest, the number of **compounding periods**  makes a significant difference. Generally, the **higher** the number of  compounding periods, the **greater** the amount of compound interest.

### Annuity

-    An annuity is a financial product that **pays out a fixed** stream of payments to an individual.
-   Primarily used by retirees.
-   Annuities exist first in an **accumulation phase**, whereby investors fund the product with either a lump-sum or periodic payments.
-   Once the **annuitization phase** has been reached, the product begins paying out to the person for either a fixed period or for the annuitant's  remaining lifetime.
-   Different types are fixed , variable , deferred etc depending upon the type of risk.

### Market Interest Rate

-   Just as price of good is determined by demand and supply . Credit and Debit is also determined by market forces.
-   Ex. **bond rates** 
-   The rate of interest is  applicable on two types of money
    1.  **Cash Deposits**
    2.  **Loans**

-   #### Cash Deposits

    -   The rate of interest depends upon
        -   **demand and supply of deposits**
        -   **duration** 
        -   **amount** 

    -   For higher rate of interest , supply of deposits should be **lower** and duration should be **longer** and amount should be **higher**. 

-   #### Loans

    -   The rate of interest on loans depends on
        -   **supply and demand of credits**
        -   **duration** ( longer the duration higher the rate )
        -   **type of security offered** ( Higher quality --> lower rate )

### Nominal Interest Rate

-   Itâ€™s a **constant** interest rate that is to be paid on a loan or bond.
-   Also called as **coupon rate** as it is constant.
-   Ex. 5% nominal interest rate means that $5 to be paid for $100 loan.
-   Does **not** take inflation or any other economic factor into consideration for interest rate.   

### Real Interest Rate

-   It factors **inflation** into consideration for calculating rate of interest on loans or bonds .
-   **Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation **
-   Can be **negative **if inflation is greater than nominal interest rate .

### Effective Interest Rate

-   It takes the concept of **compounding** into account .
-   For example, if a bond pays 6% annually and compounds **semiannually**, an  investor who places $1,000 in this bond will receive $30 of interest  payments after the first 6 months ($1,000 x .03), and $30.90 of interest after the next six months ($1,030 x .03).
-   As the no. of compounding period **increases** the effective rate of interest on loan or bond increases.

### Money Management

-   It is the process of budgeting , planning , spending and overseeing the capital usage of an individual or a group.
-   Financial advisers or asset manager are people that are involved in managing portfolio of an company.
